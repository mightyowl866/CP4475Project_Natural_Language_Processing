# CP4475 Natural Language Project

This repo cotains my final project for CP4475. You can test the web page by clicking on the github pages link.

You can ask it basic questions about Portal 2. Such as who created it, who was the antagonist, etc.

Uses Tensorflow.js's QNA model and Universal Sentence Encoder.
